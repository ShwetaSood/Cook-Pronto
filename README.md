# Cook-Pronto <br>
The motivation of this project was that there aren't any Food apps that allow to search recipes based on only the ingredients specified. Usecase: You turn up late at home and need to binge on something easy to cook, yet delicious! You can try our 'Lazy Bee' option to choose easy to cook recipes within 15 minutes, specifying only the ingredients you have at the moment. <br>
<br>
Cook Pronto allows to search recipes based on user preferences such as time and also takes care of the avoided ingredients. It also categories all recipes into 'Lazy Bee', 'Snacky Eve' etc to help user choose as per his/ her mood. <br>
<br>
1. Search recipes closest to preferences, by giving ingredients <br>
2. Search recipes by avoiding some ingredients you donâ€™t like <br>
3. Quick and easy look for recipes which are fast to cook. <br>
